    <p sytle = "Nixie One">I was born and raised in the metro Detroit area. In 2006 I moved to Ypsilanti, MI for college (plus some). Over 6 years ago, I moved to the city and saw the spirit and growth here and knew this was home. My partner and I now reside on the eastside in the East English village neighborhood, at our home we purchased in September 2013.</p>

 <h1 style = "font-family: Pacifico">About me</h1>
 <p sytle = "Nixie One"> I'm Christie Desnoyer, a Detroit resident with many interests and passions. My most current interest in that tech field and learning all that I can about being a backend developer as I make my way through Coding Bootcamp at Grand Circus. I enjoy the logistics and structure that OOP has to offer, and am enjyoing learning something new. I also have a huge spot in my heart for the arts. I majored in instrumental music at Eastern Michigan University where I perfected my Horn playing abilities. I am a member of the Dearborn Community Concert Band as their reisdent horn player. When I am not busy being a musician or working on my Java skills, I am usually out enjoying all the craft beer and vegan foods the state of Michigan, and Detroit more specifically, has to offer. After that, you can find me either at home with my fiance, Eric, and our two pits, Ed and Jim, or in the yoga studio perfecting my chaturanga. </p>

<p sytle = "Nixie One">My backstory is a long one. I started my dreams to a career by following my passion for music to Eastern Michigan University to study Music Education. Four years of music school taught me a lot and was an amazing opportunity. In my early twenties, I made a career switch to follow a different track and delved into the world of Make-Up Artistry.  While I enjoyed that field (and still do!), something over the last few years had was calling me to the tech scene. Immersing myself into a field that is ever growing and in need of a woman presence , I am forever grateful to have made my start at Grand Circus in the TechHire Java October 2018 cohort. The invaluable education that I have received will prepare me to take off into a tech career, and I look forward to what this new future holds for me.  </p>
